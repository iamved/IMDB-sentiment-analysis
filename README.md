# IMDB-sentiment-analysis

This is a short implementation for IMDB movie reviews sentiment analysis. Its a binary classification task, where we have a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing. I used the original dataset relased by Stanford(Large Movie Review Dataset v1.0 ). I used Bidirectional LSTM on this dataset, and got a really good accuracy(Training 94%, Testing 91%).
